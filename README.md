### Readme.md
Root level Readme - Notes for the whole project it's structure and intent

## Site Structure

Every folder (excluding node_modules) has a readme.md file describing the purpose of the folder and what it contains, each README.md file must start with a title and the second (2nd) line must be a short one line summary of the purpose of that folder. This summary is used in the generate_structure.sh script to create the structure.md file.
The intent of the Structure.md file is to give a quick overview of where in the project a particular piece of code is likely to be contained. Useful for future support, other developers and the like.
There are only 6 root level files - app.coffee, generate_structure.sh, package.json, README.md, routes.coffee and structure.md; all other files must be in a sub directory.

#App startup

The ./app.coffee file should only contain global module inits and includes to files in other directories - this keeps it clean, the structure partitioned nicely and the closures help prevent accidental overwriting of variables.

#routes

The routing for express is done in 3 files: the main file is ./routes.coffee this contains all misc routes that don't fit anywhere else. The file for all Data calls (think JSON) that pertain specifically to API functions go in the ./api/routes.coffee file. All routes that serve HTML go in the ./views/routes.coffee.
